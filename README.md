### A single Page Application using Vue-router, Laravel & Axios

This is a single page application (SPA) of a company management system for its admin, manager, and the standard employees. 
Here admin can perform all kinds of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, & Delete) actions and the manager is responsible for handling 
the employee's tasks. So basically this is a simple dashboard, but the main important factor of this project is, it doesn't 
refresh the whole page for each request. The Vue-Router makes this webpage like a standalone application, which is obvious 
for a very large organization.

I used these functionalities and tools to complete this project,
* Vue-router and Axios (a lightweight promise-based asynchronous HTTP client service)
* AdminLTE 3 dashboard with vForm validation package
* Vue-filters and Vue-progress bar package
* moment.js for timing functions
* sweet-alert for prompts
* vue.js custom event handling features
* Postman app to debug and evaluate client requests
* Laravel Passport for securing data
* base64 & Intervention for image uploading and cropping
* ACL (Access Control List) in laravel - both frontend and backend
